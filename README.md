**Wish List App**

This is a simple Wish List application built with Jetpack Compose for Android. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete their wishes.

**Features**
1.**Add Wishes**: Users can add new wishes with a title and description.

2.**View Wish List**: The app displays a list of all created wishes.
3.**Update Wishes**: Users can edit existing wishes by tapping on them.
4.**Delete Wishes**: Users can swipe to delete wishes from the list.


**Navigation:** The app uses Jetpack Compose Navigation to navigate between screens.

**UI:** The app features a clean and modern UI built with Material Design 3 components.


**Architecture**

1.**MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) : ** The app follows the MVVM architectural pattern to separate concerns and improve testability.

2.**Repository Pattern:** A repository layer is used to abstract data access and provide a single source of truth for the app's data.

3.**Room Database: **The app uses Room persistence library to store wishes locally.

4.**Kotlin Coroutines:** Coroutines are used for asynchronous operations and background tasks.

5.**Jetpack Compose:** The UI is built entirely with Jetpack Compose, a modern declarative UI toolkit for Android.
